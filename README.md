# Random-Refresh
JavaScript code for random refresh for your website\

My very first actual JavaScript code in GitHub
I came up with this because of I needed to refresh a certain page between random minutes (yes, yes, don't judge me lol)
I thought it might be helpful for those who interested or looking for such a code.
You can implement into a page through Chrome Source Code edit or the way you like.
It is a simple code but my first JavaScript code 

Thanks for reading!
